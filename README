These BASIC language programs do temperature conversions between 
Celsius degrees and Farhenheit degrees.
The use of these programs is aimed study and exercise
programming constructs and input/output operations.
They can run on MS win, GNU/Linux, MacOS, FreeDOS and
many other old computer systems and/or related emulators.
They have been tested to run on "minimal BASIC" compliant interpreters and/or compilers
(ECMA-55 1978 and ANSI X3.60-1978, 
ISO/IEC 6373:1984 "Data Processing—Programming Languages—Minimal BASIC"
internation standards).
In particular they have been tested to run
on pcbasic interpreter (MS gwbasic and mbasic compatible), 
https://robhagemans.github.io/pcbasic
on qb64.sh (qbasic compatible) 
-with few changes uncommenting the related REM lines, 
see lines 205 and 225 in F2CBIS.BAS- 
https://www.qb64.org/portal
and using the online interpreter http://www.quitebasic.com . 
With few changes they can run on By Water basic interpreter bwbasic.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bwbasic
http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/bwbasic.1.html
bwbasic interpreter syntax compatibility has been implemented
yet only for source program TCONV.BAS .
They can also run on BBC BASIC compilers, included Brandy

TCONV.BAS is a simple interactive program that has a command line
user interface, a loop prompting on the terminal the user to insert the
input and select options, until end of program is selected.
F2CBIS.BAS and C2FBIS.BAS are batch programs.

The TCONV program execute a UI infinite loop prompting the user
for input at terminal command line. The execution schema can be
described with the following pseudocode lines 
('\' symbol indicate continuation on newline):


input the user for name
greet the user
do
    ask input which conversion to do: \
        Fdeg to Cdeg or Cdeg to Fdeg
    if ( isSelected(Cdeg) ) 
    then
        ask input Cdeg Temperature value
        if Cdeg is an illegal value \
            (Cdeg < -273.15) reject and ask \
            for new input
        compute Fdeg = (9/5)*Cdeg + 32
        shows Fdeg in output
    else if isSelected(Fdeg)
    then
        ask input Fdeg Temperature value
        if Fdeg is an illegal value \
            (Fdeg < -459.67) reject and ask \
            for new input
        compute Cdeg = (Fdeg - 32)*(5/9) 
        shows Cdeg in output
    end if
    ask input if user want go on
    reject unexpected answers \
        (different from yes or no)
until (user want to continue)
say goodbye to the user

C2F.BAS and F2C.BAS are batch programs that read
from input file and save output to stdout
and info on logfile F2C2F.LOG .
Who is using pcbasic to run this code example
can launch it from terminal with the command
pcbasic -qn  C2F.BAS
# or
pcbasic -qn  F2C.BAS
# more in general
pcbasic -qn --preset=olivetti  <programname.bas>
# where <programname.bas> is a placeholder
# for the actual program file name, to be
# substituted
