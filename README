These BASIC language programs do temperature conversions between 
Celsius degrees and Farhenheit degrees.
The use of these programs is aimed study and exercise
programming constructs and input/output operations.
They can run on MS win, GNU/Linux, MacOS, FreeDOS and
many other old computer systems and/or related emulators.
They have been tested to run on "minimal BASIC" compliant interpreters and/or compilers
(ECMA-55 1978 and ANSI X3.60-1978, 
ISO/IEC 6373:1984 "Data Processing—Programming Languages—Minimal BASIC"
internation standards).
In particular they have been tested to run
on pcbasic interpreter (MS gwbasic and mbasic compatible), 
https://robhagemans.github.io/pcbasic
on qb64.sh (qbasic compatible) 
-with few changes uncommenting the related REM lines, 
see lines 205 and 225 in F2CBIS.BAS- 
https://www.qb64.org/portal
and using the online interpreter http://www.quitebasic.com . 
With few changes they can run on By Water basic interpreter bwbasic.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bwbasic
http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/bwbasic.1.html
bwbasic interpreter syntax compatibility has been implemented
yet only for source program TCONV.BAS .
They can also run on BBC BASIC compilers, included Brandy

TCONV.BAS is a simple interactive program that has a command line
user interface, a loop prompting on the terminal the user to insert the
input and select options, until end of program is selected.
F2CBIS.BAS and C2FBIS.BAS are batch programs.
